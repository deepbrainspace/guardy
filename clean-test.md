# Clean Test File

This file contains no secrets and should pass all pre-commit checks.

## Testing Summary

- ✅ Custom hooks work (echo and date commands)
- ✅ Built-in secret scanning works (blocks commits with secrets)
- ✅ Pre-commit hook executes successfully
- ⚠️ Commit-msg validation is placeholder only (not fully implemented)

## Hook Configuration

The hooks are configured in `guardy.yaml` and installed in `.git/hooks/`.
