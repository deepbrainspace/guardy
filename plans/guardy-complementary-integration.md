# Guardy Complementary Integration Plan: Protected Sync + Hook Manager Integration

## Executive Summary

Transform Guardy from a Lefthook replacement into a **complementary protected sync tool** that integrates seamlessly with existing hook managers (Lefthook, Husky, pre-commit). This approach leverages Lefthook's mature 6.4k-star ecosystem while focusing Guardy on its unique value proposition: **protected file synchronization**.

## Strategic Pivot: Complementary vs Competitive

### ❌ Previous Approach: Full Lefthook Replacement
- **15-20 hours** to build comprehensive hook management 
- **Competing directly** with mature, feature-rich Lefthook
- **Reinventing the wheel** for parallel execution, file variables, custom scripts

### ✅ New Approach: Complementary Integration
- **4-6 hours** to build core protected sync + hook integration
- **Leveraging existing** hook manager investments and knowledge
- **Focusing on unique value**: Protected sync capabilities no other tool provides

## Core Value Proposition

**Guardy becomes the "configuration guardian" that works alongside any hook manager:**

```yaml
# guardy.yml - Focus on what makes Guardy unique
sync:
  repos:
    - name: build-toolkit
      repo: org/build-toolkit  
      version: v1.2.3
      files:
        - lefthook.yml          # Sync hook configs
        - rust-toolchain.toml   # Sync toolchain configs
        - .editorconfig         # Sync editor settings
      protected: true           # Prevent manual modification

# Guardy enhances existing hook managers, doesn't replace them
integration:
  hook_manager: lefthook        # Works with lefthook, husky, pre-commit
  security_scan: true           # Add security scanning to existing hooks
  sync_trigger: post-checkout   # Auto-sync on branch changes
```

## Architecture Overview

### Phase 1: Core Protected Sync (2-3 hours)
```

    └── integration.rs       # Integration-specific configuration
```

## Integration Strategies

### 1. Lefthook Integration (Primary)

**Guardy enhances Lefthook rather than replacing it:**

```yaml
# lefthook.yml (managed by Guardy sync)
pre-commit:
  parallel: true
  commands:
    rust-format:
      glob: "*.rs" 
      run: cargo fmt {staged_files}
    guardy-security:              # Guardy adds security scanning
      run: guardy scan {staged_files}
      fail_fast: true

post-checkout:
  commands:
    guardy-sync:                  # Guardy handles config sync
      run: guardy sync --auto
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Zero learning curve** - Lefthook users keep their existing configuration
- ✅ **Best of both worlds** - Lefthook's maturity + Guardy's protection
- ✅ **Gradual adoption** - Add Guardy features incrementally

### 2. Husky Integration

```json
// package.json (enhanced by Guardy)
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "guardy scan && lint-staged",
      "post-checkout": "guardy sync --auto"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Pre-commit Integration

```yaml  
# .pre-commit-config.yaml (enhanced by Guardy)
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: guardy-security
        name: Security scan
        entry: guardy scan
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
      - id: guardy-sync-check
        name: Sync validation
        entry: guardy protected check
        language: system
```

## Simplified Integration Approach - No Complex Hook Detection Needed

### Documentation-Based Integration

Instead of complex programmatic integration, provide simple documentation:

```markdown
# Guardy Integration Guide

## For Lefthook users:
1. Run `guardy sync update --repo=github.com/org/build-toolkit.git --version=v1.2.3`
2. Run `lefthook install` to install hooks
3. Done! Your hooks now include guardy validation

## For Husky users:
Add to your package.json:
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "guardy sync check && your-existing-commands"
    }
  }
}

## For pre-commit users:
Add to .pre-commit-config.yaml:
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: guardy-check
      name: Guardy sync validation
      entry: guardy sync check
      language: system
```

### Core Commands (Ultimate Simplicity)

```bash
# Initial setup (one-time, self-bootstrapping)
guardy sync update --repo=github.com/org/build-toolkit.git --version=v1.2.3

# Ongoing usage (reads from local guardy.yml that was synced)
guardy sync check               # Validate sync status - exits 1 if out of sync
guardy sync update              # Pull latest from configured repos
guardy sync update --force      # Force update, overwrite local changes  
guardy sync show                # Show current sync configuration and status
```

## Configuration Architecture

### Self-Contained Build-Toolkit Approach (Even Simpler!)

**No local guardy.yml needed!** Everything lives in the build-toolkit:

```
build-toolkit/
├── guardy.yml              # Guardy sync configuration
├── lefthook.yml            # Hook configuration with guardy sync check
├── rust-toolchain.toml     # Toolchain specification
├── .editorconfig           # Editor settings
└── README.md               # Setup instructions
```

**build-toolkit/guardy.yml:**
```yaml
# Self-contained sync configuration
sync:
  repos:
    - name: self
      repo: github.com/org/build-toolkit.git  # References itself!
      version: v1.2.3
      source_path: "."
      dest_path: "."
      include: ["*"]
      exclude: [".git/", "target/", "*.log"]
      protected: true

protection:
  auto_protect_synced: true
  block_modifications: true
```

**Initial setup becomes trivial:**
```bash
# One command setup - pulls everything including guardy.yml itself!
guardy sync update --repo=github.com/org/build-toolkit.git --version=v1.2.3

# That's it! Now you have:
# - guardy.yml (with self-referencing config)
# - lefthook.yml (with guardy sync check already configured)
# - All other standardized files
```

### Simple Integration Pattern - No Complex Hook Manager Integration Needed

**The key insight**: Guardy becomes a standalone validator that existing hooks call.

```yaml
# lefthook.yml (from build-toolkit, synced by Guardy)
pre-commit:
  parallel: true
  commands:
    rust-format:
      glob: "*.rs"
      run: cargo fmt {staged_files}
    guardy-check:                 # Simple validation call
      run: guardy sync check      # Returns error if out of sync
      fail_fast: true
      
post-checkout:
  commands:
    guardy-update:                # Auto-sync on branch changes
      run: guardy sync update
```

**How the self-contained approach works:**
1. **Bootstrap**: `guardy sync update --repo=... --version=...` pulls everything including `guardy.yml`
2. **Self-referencing**: The synced `guardy.yml` contains config to sync from itself
3. **Hook installation**: User runs `lefthook install` (lefthook.yml already has guardy commands)
4. **Automatic updates**: `guardy sync update` now reads local config to stay in sync
5. **Protection**: `guardy sync check` validates everything is current

## Implementation Timeline (Minimal - Just 3 Hours!)

### Hour 1: Core Sync Functionality
```rust
// Just the essential sync logic - dead simple
pub struct SyncManager {
    repos: Vec<SyncRepo>,
}

impl SyncManager {
    pub fn check_sync_status(&self) -> Result<bool>;    // guardy sync check
    pub fn update_all_repos(&self, force: bool) -> Result<()>; // guardy sync update [--force]
    pub fn show_status(&self) -> Result<String>;        // guardy sync show
}
```

### Hour 2: File Operations & Git Integration
```rust  
// Simple file sync and git operations
impl SyncRepo {
    pub fn clone_or_fetch(&self) -> Result<PathBuf>;    // Get repo content
    pub fn copy_files(&self, force: bool) -> Result<()>; // Apply include/exclude patterns
    pub fn check_differences(&self) -> Result<Vec<PathBuf>>; // Find out-of-sync files
}
```

### Hour 3: CLI Subcommands Implementation
```rust
// src/cli/commands/sync.rs - Single sync command with subcommands
pub enum SyncSubcommand {
    Check,                      // Validate sync status
    Update { force: bool },     // Update from repos
    Show,                       // Show configuration
}

impl SyncSubcommand {
    pub fn execute(&self, config: &GuardyConfig) -> Result<()> {
        match self {
            Self::Check => self.check_sync(config),
            Self::Update { force } => self.update_sync(config, *force),
            Self::Show => self.show_sync(config),
        }
    }
}
```
